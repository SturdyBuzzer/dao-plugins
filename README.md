## Main Features

### Full Virtualization of the Dragon Age User Folder

* The *entire* **DAO** user folder at
  `%UserProfile%\Documents\Bioware\Dragon Age` is now included in MO2‚Äôs virtualization.
* Previously this was limited to `packages\core\override`.
* Now **any** file (Settings, AddIns, Offers, etc.) can be overridden.
* Makes full use of Mod Organizer‚Äôs mod priority and conflict detection systems.

### Full Install Support for DAO Mod Types

* Automatically detects and installs **.dazip** packages.
* Supports **.override** packages (the ones built from [DAO-Modmanager](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/277)).
* Triggers any `OverrideConfig.xml` install scripts included with `.override` packages.
* Auto-sorting and management for Overrides, Docs, Binaries, etc.

### Dynamic `Addins.xml` and `Offers.xml` Generation

*(Settings ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Dragon Age Origins Support Plugin ‚Üí `build_addins_offers_xml`)*

* On **game launch**, the plugin detects all installed **DLC** and `.dazip` mods currently active.
* Generates new `Addins.xml` and `Offers.xml` files in the MO2 `%BASE_DIR%/Overwrite` directory.
* Files are fully removed when the game stops.
* Original files in the user directory remain untouched.
* No more worrying about mods and DLC not being loaded into the game!

### Dynamic `Chargenmorphcfg.xml` Generation

*(Settings ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Dragon Age Origins Support Plugin ‚Üí `build_chargenmorphcfg_xml`)*

* On **game launch**, detects all installed cosmetic/chargen mods (Hair, Eyes, Beard, etc.).
* Generates a new `Chargenmorphcfg.xml` in the MO2 `%BASE_DIR%/Overwrite` directory.
* Competing `Chargenmorphcfg.xml` files are temporarily hidden.
* Restored when the game stops.
* No more manual consolidation of chargenmorph files!
* Ensures all cosmetic mods show up in character creation.

### Auto-Deploy Mod Added Binaries/Executables

*(Settings ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Dragon Age Origins Support Plugin ‚Üí `deploy_bin_ship`)*

* `bin_ship` is now a special sub-folder in your mods.
* On launch, the plugin deploys any files in `%Mods_Path%\<mod name>\bin_ship` into the game‚Äôs `%GAME_DIR%\bin_ship`.
* Useful for DXVK, DAFix, script extenders, etc.
* Restores the `bin_ship` directory when the game stops.

### Configurable Override Modes

*(Settings ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Dragon Age Origins Support Plugin ‚Üí `flatten_override`)*

1. **Flatten Override (default):**

   * Auto flattens all sub-directories in `packages\core\override`.
   * Select your desired override files at the install mods dialog then click "ok" to auto-flatten.
   * Enables full conflict detection and priority handling via MO2.

2. **Old-school:**

   * Keeps `packages\core\override` directory structure intact.
   * Manual conflict resolution by alphabetical order (e.g., `zzz_myFavoritemod...`).
   * For those who like it the *old fashioned* way.

### Save Game Management

* Extends MO2‚Äôs **profile-local save games** to DAO saves.
* View DAO savegame metadata in MO2‚Äôs Saves tab.
